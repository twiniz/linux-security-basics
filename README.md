# Linux Security Basics 🐧🔐

This repository documents my beginner-level learning of Linux fundamentals with a focus on cybersecurity and system security concepts.

The goal of this project is to understand how Linux systems work, how they are managed, and how security issues can be identified at the operating system level.

## What I’m Learning

- Basic Linux command-line navigation
- File and directory permissions
- User and group management concepts
- Important Linux directories
- Where system logs are stored and why they matter

## Key Linux Commands Practiced

| Command | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| `ls` | List files and directories |
| `pwd` | Show current directory |
| `cd` | Navigate directories |
| `cat` | View file contents |
| `chmod` | Change file permissions |
| `chown` | Change file ownership |
| `whoami` | Display current user |
| `history` | View command history |

## Security Relevance

Understanding Linux is essential for cybersecurity because:
- Misconfigured permissions can lead to privilege escalation
- Logs help detect suspicious activity
- User management impacts access control
- Many servers and security tools run on Linux

---

## Learning Approach

I am learning by:
- Practicing commands in a Linux environment
- Taking notes on what each command does
- Connecting Linux concepts to real-world security scenarios

This repository will continue to improve as I learn more.
